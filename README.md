# Data-Visualization-project-using-Tableau

# Introducation
In this project, We'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a Flight Delays and Cancellations Dataset. We will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. our work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.


# Dataset
- [Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data).

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

•	Visuals (1) Most Airlines Flights in 2015.

[Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abdallah.el.sawy/viz/MostAirlinesFlightsin2015/MostAirlinesFlights)


- Summary:
Which are the airlines having the biggest number of flights during 2015? We find that it is WN or Southwest Airlines Co. and the least one is VX or Virgin America.

- Design:
I chose the airlines column vis the count for flights to every airline that we have then apply the visualize using horizontal bar chart and sort them to be clearer to see which airline with bigger and lower flights.

•	Visuals (2) The Cancellation Reasons.

Summary:
After we saw the number of cancelations over 2015. Let us see the reasons of those cancelation. If we watched the plot, we see that there are some reasons for the cancellations like A which is Airline Carrier reasons, B which is Weather reasons, C which is National Air System reasons. We find that the worst reason that we have and need immediately plan to deal with it; is Weather reasons with 54.07% of the total cancelations.

Design:
By using pie chart, it will give us a percentage for every cancellation and make every type with different color to be clear.

•	Visuals (3) Airlines Cancelled Flights count over 2015

Link:
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abdallah.el.sawy/viz/Cancelledflightsover2015/Cancelledflightsover2015?publish=yes


Summary:
If we saw the visualization, we find that we able to compere between the number of flights that cancelled over 2015 for every airline. That will give us an indication of the performance of every airline over the time of the year. So, we find the most time that airlines have number of cancelations in February and best time is September.

Design:
I used the line plot to give a chart that describe the cancelled flights over the time.

•	Visuals (4) Which airlines have the worst delays?

https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abdallah.el.sawy/viz/Whichairlineshavetheworstdelays_16471035579520/Whichairlineshavetheworstdelays?publish=yes


Summary:
Let us come to most important factor that measure the performance of different Airlines. If we checked the visualization, it will give us some indication of which is the best type with less delays over the year and that is the VX or Virgin America Airline. And the worst Airline with biggest total delay over the year is WN Southwest Airlines Co.

Design:
To design a good plot that describes the delays for every Arline Co I used the tree map using the Airline Delay time sum over 2015 with the Airlines names column.

Summary:
It is a dashboard describes the Flight Delays and Cancellations over the year 2015 to indicates very useful details about every Airline CO.

Design:
Used the all visualization to build this interactive dashboard.

Summary:
It is a Story describes the Flight Delays and Cancellations over the year 2015 to indicates very useful details about every Airline CO.

Design:
Used the all visualization to build a story describes the all visualization and a summary indicates every one of them.
