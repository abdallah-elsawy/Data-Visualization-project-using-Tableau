# Data-Visualization-project-using-Tableau

# Introducation
In this project, We'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a Flight Delays and Cancellations Dataset. We will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. our work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.


# Dataset
